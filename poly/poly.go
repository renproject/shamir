// Poly represents a polynomial in the field defined by the elliptic curve

// the secp256k1 group.

// A Poly can be indexed into, where index `i` will be the `i`th coefficient.
// For example, the constant term is index 0.
//
// Since this type just aliases a slice, all of the considerations of using a
// slice apply. For example, attempting to access coefficients outside of the
// length bound will panic, as will using a polynomial in a context where its
// capacity is too small (e.g. copying a polynomial that is too large for the
// destination's capacity). The fact that this type is an alias also means that
// it is possible to directly modify properties of the slice and the underlying
// memory. To ensure the correct functioning of this type, these manual
// modificaitons should be avoided, and rather the provided methods used.
